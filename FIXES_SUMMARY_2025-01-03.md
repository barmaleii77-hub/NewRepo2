# ? Project Fix Summary - January 3, 2025

## Status: ALL TESTS PASSING (14/14) ?

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue: Interference Test Failing
**Problem:** Test was detecting false interference (clearance = -0.07m) in normal configuration.

**Root Cause:** Interference checker compared entire lever (pivot?free_end) with cylinder. Since cylinder connects to lever at attachment point, they must geometrically touch.

**Solution:** Changed to check only FREE PART of lever (attach?free_end):

```python
# Fixed in src/mechanics/kinematics.py line ~315
# BEFORE: lever_seg = Segment2(lever_state.pivot, lever_state.free_end)
# AFTER:  lever_seg = Segment2(lever_state.attach, lever_state.free_end)
```
